This is a little helper script to teach Spamassassin through Thunderbird using
Courier IMAP.

When using IMAP, Thunderbird tags marked spam or ham mails on the server. The
script read those tags and feeds sa-learn with the corresponding emails.

Look at the contributed config file (which has sane pre-settings already) and
run the script like

its.py -c myconfigfile /path/to/my/mails

on a regulary basis.

-c can be ommited if /etc/its.conf exists.

Have fun.
